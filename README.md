# Lambda-Calculus-and-Prolog-Interpreters

This repository contains implementations of interpreters for [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) and Prolog written in OCaml.

The Lambda calculus interpreter is capable of reducing lambda expressions using different reduction strategies like call-by-order, call-by-name and normal order.

The Prolog interpreter is capable of evaluating queries based on the provided facts and rules. It also has the ability to recover from mistakes in interpretation by backtracking and supports multiple choice points.
